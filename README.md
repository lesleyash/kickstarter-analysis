# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise to understand how the outcomes of campaigns are related to launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
I created Pivot table to summarize the number of events based on outcome(Success, failed and canceled). Then a line chart was created to provide the visualization of the results.

The challenge is the original data are not structured to be easily analyzed. I have created additional columns to extract key information from original data.
